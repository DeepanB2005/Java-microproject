Teacher Feedback Form Project
Overview
The Teacher Feedback Form Project is a Java-based application designed to collect structured feedback from students about teachers. The system enables students to rate teachers on various skills such as interaction, teaching, knowledge, clarity, and punctuality, along with providing additional comments. Feedback is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring data persistence and enabling future analysis.

Features
Student Feedback Collection:
Ratings for skills: interaction, teaching, knowledge, clarity, and punctuality.
Option to provide additional comments.
Database Integration:
Feedback is securely stored in a relational database (MySQL).
User-Friendly Interface:
Simple GUI built with Java Swing.
Data Retrieval:
Administrators can retrieve and analyze feedback records.
Technologies Used
Languages:
Java: For application logic and GUI.
SQL: For database management and data storage.
Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Classes and objects for modular design.
Encapsulation and abstraction to manage feedback operations.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
Seamless integration of Java with MySQL for CRUD operations.
Swing Framework:
GUI components such as JTextField, JComboBox, and JTextArea.
Database Schema
The feedback data is stored in the teacher_feedback table in the feedback_db database.

Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	INT	Auto-increment primary key.
student_name	VARCHAR(255)	Name of the student.
teacher_name	VARCHAR(255)	Name of the teacher.
interaction	INT	Rating for interaction skills (1-5).
teaching	INT	Rating for teaching skills (1-5).
knowledge	INT	Rating for subject knowledge (1-5).
clarity	INT	Rating for clarity (1-5).
punctuality	INT	Rating for punctuality (1-5).
comments	TEXT	Additional comments by the student.
Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
JDK (Java Development Kit) installed (JDK 17 or higher recommended).
MySQL installed and running.
MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver) downloaded.
2. Database Setup
Open MySQL Workbench or CLI.
Execute the following SQL script to create the database and table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE feedback_db;

USE feedback_db;

CREATE TABLE teacher_feedback (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    teacher_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    interaction INT CHECK (interaction BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    teaching INT CHECK (teaching BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    knowledge INT CHECK (knowledge BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    clarity INT CHECK (clarity BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    punctuality INT CHECK (punctuality BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    comments TEXT
);
3. Project Setup
Clone or download the project files.
Add the MySQL Connector/J JAR file to your project classpath.
4. Compilation and Execution
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
bash
Copy code
javac -d . -cp mysql-connector-j-X.X.X.jar com/feedback/*.java
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
java -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-X.X.X.jar" com.feedback.TeacherFeedbackForm
How to Use
Run the Program:
Launch the application.
Submit Feedback:
Fill in the form fields, including student and teacher names, ratings, and comments.
Click Submit to save the feedback to the database.
View Feedback:
Query the database directly or implement a feature to retrieve and display feedback records.
Future Enhancements
Generate graphical reports for teacher performance.
Convert the desktop application into a web-based or mobile-friendly solution.
Add login authentication for students and administrators.
Conclusion
This project provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing teacher feedback. It is designed to improve teaching quality through constructive feedback and data-driven insights.
